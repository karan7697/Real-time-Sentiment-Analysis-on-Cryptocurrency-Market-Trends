# Real-time Sentiment Analysis on Cryptocurrency Market Trends

## Overview
Constructed a real-time system to ingest and preprocess data from Twitter and Google News, achieving 91% accuracy with NLTKâ€™s VADER and fine-tuned BERT Transformer. Deployed dashboards for visualization and used AWS S3 for storage.

## Tech Stack
- AWS (SageMaker, Kinesis)
- Apache Kafka
- NLTK
- BERT Transformer
